    <h1>Pricing Policy</h1>

    <p>
        Welcome to <strong>SatendraCoder.com</strong>. Our pricing policy ensures transparency and fairness for all our
        learners and clients. By using our website or services, you agree to the terms below.
    </p>

    <h2>SatendraCoder.com Pricing Policy</h2>

    <h3>1. Price Range</h3>
    <p>
        Pricing varies based on the type of service, course, or tool. Most offerings fall between <strong>INR 500 to INR
            13,000</strong>, depending on complexity, duration, and included features. All prices are shared
        transparently before purchase.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Schedule of Payment</h3>
    <p>
        Time-based services such as course access or premium subscriptions have clearly defined validity periods,
        ranging from <strong>1 month to 12 months</strong>. The duration is always mentioned on the product/service
        description.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Price Matching</h3>
    <p>
        We aim to offer competitive pricing. If you find a similar course or service elsewhere at a lower verified
        price, we may consider matching it. <em>Note: Price matching excludes promotional offers, coupons, gift cards,
            or auction site prices.</em>
    </p>

    <h3>4. Sale Adjustment</h3>
    <p>
        If a course or service you purchased goes on sale within <strong>14 days</strong> of your purchase, we’ll offer
        a one-time price adjustment. This applies only to regular-priced services, not items already purchased at a
        discounted rate.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Pricing Errors</h3>
    <p>
        While we strive for 100% accuracy, unintentional pricing errors may occur. If the listed price is lower than the
        actual cost, we reserve the right to cancel the order and notify you before processing.
    </p>

    <h3>6. Shopping Cart & Checkout</h3>
    <p>
        Prices in your cart reflect the most current listed rates. Prices may update dynamically due to active sales or
        changes. All purchases are for personal use only—orders may be canceled if misuse or resale is suspected.
